- added a check on the APIs for undefined fetches, was causing an issue earlier where 1 undefined array would break the whole thing
- beware of fetching too far back for APOD, it takes a while to get the site to load
## 2023-09-25
- fixing up the load more button, specifically the look of the button and the logic of getting more posts
